Experimenting with openai to create an mock interview tool


Technologies I am thinking of using:
Backend:
FastAPI, PostgreSQL, SQLalchemy, Oauth?, redis?, openai

FrontEnd:
React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS, tanstack or react query?

start on mvp, allow them to ask system design and specifc leetcode questions
